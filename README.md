# Fully Convolutional Neural Network for Multiple-Label Object Recognition in Images

This is an implimentation of FCN for multiple-label object recognition using K-hot vector enocding. This model is trained and evaluated with the MS COCO2017 dataset.
The follow python libraries are required:

-   PyTorch
-   Numpy
-   Matplotlib
-   Argparse
-   OS
-   Time
-   Itertools

## How to train and evaluate models

-   To start training a model, open two terminal instances and nativate to the project folder.
-   With the project folder as the working directory
